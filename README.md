## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my solution to the **Recipe Page** challenge on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).  

This challenge helps improve frontend skills by building realistic projects using HTML and CSS.

## The Challenge

The task was to build a responsive recipe page that closely matches the provided design.  
I focused on using semantic HTML, a mobile-first approach, and styling with CSS to replicate the colors, typography, and layout from the design.

## Where to Find Everything

All project assets, including images and fonts, are in the `/assets` folder.  
The design files (mobile and desktop) were provided as JPGs in the `/design` folder.  

I also referred to the `style-guide.md` file to implement the correct color palette, fonts, and typography.
